            “Had the camel hurt its leg?” asked Raman.
            
            “Oh yes! That means you have seen my camel!” said the merchant.
            
            “Only its footprints. See, you can see footprints of an animal with three legs,” said Raman, pointing out the footprints on the<br> ground. “It was dragging the other leg because it was hurt in that leg.”  
            
            “Was it blind in one eye?” Raman asked the merchant.

            “Yes, yes,” said the merchant eagerly.

            “Was it loaded it with wheat on one side and sugar on the other side?” asked Raman.

            “Yes, you are right,” said the merchant.

            “So you have seen my camel!”  exclaimed the merchant.

            Raman looked upset. “Did I say I saw your camel?”

            “You have given the exact description of my camel,” said the merchant.

            “I saw no camel,” said Raman.
        
            “Do you see those plants lined up on both sides of this path? You can clearly see, some animal has eaten leaves of plants on <br>the left, but the plants on the other side remain untouched. So the animal could see with only one eye.

            “Look down. You can see ants lined up on this side which means, the animal was loaded with sugar bag on this side. The bag had<br> a hole, which allowed the sugar to fall off.”
        
            “You can see grains of wheat fallen on the other side. The bag on this side also must have holes in it,” said Raman.

            “I can see everything you showed me,” protested the merchant,”but I still don’t see my camel.”
        
            “You follow this trail and soon you will catch up with your animal. After all it is hurt in one leg and you seem to be hale and<br> hearty,” said Raman.

            The merchant took his advice and followed the trail left by the camel.

            Soon he caught up with the poor animal, limping along.

            “Rani!” the merchant shouted in happiness, as he ran to his camel.</h3>

            When Sudama went to Dwaraka, his childhood friend Sri Krishna and his wife Rukmini, received him with affection. They persuaded <br>Sudama to stay with them for a few days. Then they took him back to his village in their chariot.

            Meanwhile, in the village, word spread that Sri Krishna was coming to their village. Villagers began to gather in Sudama’s <br>cottage.
 
            “Sri Krishna and Rukmini are visiting our Sudama’s house. We must make it fit for their visit,” said an elder.

            “Let’s build a new home for our Sudama,” cried out a villager and all agreed.

            The villagers worked day and night to build a big and spacious house, and decorated it with festoons. They brought new clothes<br> and ornaments for Sudama’s family. They drew Rangoli (Kolam) in front of Sudama’s house and decorated it with flowers.
 
            Sudama’s wife thanked the villagers for their affection.
 
            Villagers lined up on both sides of the streets hailing Sri Krishna as he drove by. Sri Krishna stopped the chariot, jumped<br> down and mingled with the villagers. Girls came running to him with dandiya and Sri Krishna danced with them.

            At last, the procession reached Sudama’s house. Sudama’s wife brought water for Sri Krishna and Rukmini to wash their feet. <br>Sudama wiped their feet dry with the cloth his wife gave him. His children fell at Sri Krishna’s feet.
        
            “Bhabhi,” said Sri Krishna, “I’m hungry. What do you have for me?”

            Sudama’s wife smiled.

            “Govinda, I offer you what you have given us,” she said.

            Then she brought him a bowl full of butter!

            Sri Krishna jumped with joy as Rukmini clapped. The villagers joined their hands in salutation as Sri Krishna put the butter<br> into his mouth.</h3>

        A fox passed by a grapevine winding around the branches of a tree. He saw a bunch of grapes hanging above. He jumped to snatch some <br>grapes. But the grapes were too high for him.

        “You have to grow up fox,” said a monkey living on the tree; “here take some grapes.”
        
        The monkey shook the branch and a few grapes fell out. The fox caught them neatly in his mouth.
        
        “Are they sweet?” asked the monkey.
        
        “Not so sweet,” the fox said as he walked away.
        
        The next day, the fox came by the tree again.
    
        He took a look at the bunches of grapes hanging above. He took a short run and jumped. This time he could jump higher, but not high<br> enough to get at the grapes. The friendly monkey pressed down the branch, helping the fox snatch one or two grapes as they fell.

        “Is it sweet?” asked the monkey.

        “Not so sweet,” said the fox as he walked away.

        The next day, the fox was back.

        This time he looked determined to get the grapes.

        He carefully measured the run-up. He started slowly, picked up speed, and then jumped. This time he could get at the grapes. As he <br>came down with a bunch of grapes between his teeth, the monkey clapped.

        “Is it sweet?” asked the monkey.

        “These are the sweetest grapes I have ever tasted,” said the fox with a laugh as he walked away.

        The monkey scratched his head. “It is the same vine. How can the grapes taste different today?” he wondered.

        The wise tree, which was a silent witness to all this, spoke: “this time he got the grapes from his own effort. That made them<br> sweeter.”

        The monkey nodded his head in agreement as he popped a juicy grape into his mouth.</h3>

    Ronak was feeling bad. The coach was nasty to him. He had given him a scolding in front of his friends, asking him not to show his face<br> if he was not interested in the game. Ronak decided to bury his dream of becoming a footballer.

    But he still felt hurt. Ronak wanted to get rid of that horrible pain. He went for a long walk. Dusk fell. Suddenly, he realized it was<br> dark and he had reached the outskirts of the city. He turned back.
    
    It was then that he spotted a Hanuman temple. Devotees had gathered for the evening prayer. After prayers, the devotees left. There was<br> no one except Ronak who was looking at a stone left outside the temple. “I’m as useless as this stone, not wanted by anybody,” said Ronak <br>to himself. People used the stone to break coconuts, which were offered to Hanumanji.
    
    “I know how you feel. My brother and I lay here on the ground for centuries. Nobody looked at us. Nobody cared for us.”
    
    Ronak was startled to hear the voice. Was it the stone speaking or was it his imagination?

    “One day a sculptor picked me up. He broke me into two pieces. He left one half here; that’s me. I’m the lowly stone used for breaking<br> coconuts. The other half is the stone that these people honour as Hanumanji,” said the stone.

    Ronak looked at the idol of Hanuman, beautifully decorated, with lamps burning in front of it. He felt sorry for the stone outside.
 
    “If I’m honoured today, I’ve earned it, brother,” said a soft voice. Ronak was surprised to hear the voice was coming from the temple<br> idol.

    “The sculptor worked on me with his chisel and hammer. He kept hammering over me. It was so painful. As I cried in pain, you brother,<br> laughed at my plight. You were happy you were spared by the sculptor. I had to take all the beating. He then applied sandal paste on me.<br> That was very soothing. Then, they gave me a bath. They dressed me up and garlanded me. They called me Hanuman and people started<br> worshiping me.”

    “You were spared all the hammering. I took all the hammering. Today, I’m here honoured by the devotees who see Hanumanji in me and you<br> remain where you are.”

    “Was it Hanumanji speaking?” Ronak wondered.

    There was a soft glow of lamps burning in front of Hanumanji.

    Yes. It was an ordinary stone, like any other stone. After all the hammering it received, it became an adorable idol, Hanumanji.

    Ronak found himself smiling. All the scolding of the coach was nothing compared to the hammering Hanumanji received when he was a <br>stone, thought Ronak.

    He bowed to Hanumanji and left.

    Next day, Ronak reported to his coach. He was ready to be hammered into shape as a footballer.</h3>

    Sampati was an old eagle. He lived alone on a rock on the southern seashore. One day, he noticed that the beach was crowded with <br>monkeys. He asked the monkeys what had brought them to the seashore. Where were they from? Jambuvan, an elderly bear, spoke, “Rama, the<br> prince of Ayodhya was living in the forest with his wife, Sita, and brother, Lakshmana. When the two brothers were away from their cottage,<br> someone carried away Sita. Our king, Sugriva, is a friend of Rama. He has sent us in search of Sita.”

    An old bird remembered having seen a woman being carried away by Ravana, a Rakshasa King.
    
    “So, that woman was Rama’s wife, Sita!” exclaimed the old eagle.
    
    “Ravana took her to his island fortress of Lanka,” said the old bird. “Lanka is on the other side of this sea - hundreds of miles away.”
    
    “Let’s jump across the sea,” said a monkey.

    “Wait,” said the monkey commander. “Tell me first, what is your potential?” he asked.

    The monkey blinked. “What do you mean by potential?” he asked.

    “What is your capacity to jump? I mean, how far do you think you can jump?” asked the monkey commander.

    The monkey thought it over and said, “20 feet.”

    “Then you will fall right into the sea,” screamed a little monkey and everybody laughed.

    “Silence!” shouted the commander.

    Another monkey could jump 100 feet, another 200 feet and so on. But no monkey thought he could jump hundreds of miles to reach Lanka.

    “There is one hero among us who can leap to Lanka” wise Jambuvan said, pointing out to a monkey who was sitting all alone.

    “You mean Hanuman?” asked the commander, “But he is not even talking. He is so quiet.”

    “That is because Hanuman does not know his own potential,” said Jambuvan. “Let us surround him and chant a mantra, which will make him<br> discover his capability.”
    So, all the monkeys surrounded Hanuman and started chanting the mantra, “Hanuman, you can! Hanuman, you can! You can do it, Hanuman!”

    The monkeys chanted louder, “HANUMAN, YOU CAN! HANUMAN, YOU CAN!”

    As the monkeys chanted, Hanuman started growing in size. He grew bigger and bigger. He stood up, stretched his hands and took one giant<br> leap across the sea as the chant continued: “Hanuman, you can. Hanuman you can!”

    Hanuman landed in Lanka, where he found Sita, and gave her Rama’s message. He brought Sita’s message to Rama.

    Hanuman thanked his friends for helping him discover his potential.</h3>
